# Orthomolecular Facial Analysis

## Beauty From Within!

Orthomolecular Facial Analysis identifies tissue salt deficiencies and toxicities by mapping the face, skin, and eyes. It aims to recommend cellular nutrient supplementation to tackle signs of aging (wrinkles, sagging), reduce acne, and improve skin quality by addressing the root cause of these issues.

## What is Orthomolecular Beauty Therapy?

<thinking>I have read the content of `Package/content-samples/services/orthomolecular-facial-analysis.mdx`. This provides a comprehensive MDX content for the service, including frontmatter and detailed sections.

I will now create the `data/content/services/orthomolecular-facial-analysis.mdx` file with this content. This will be the first content file created for Phase 3.

I will repeat this process for all 10 services listed in `data/services.ts` and for the about page. For now, I will create this one service MDX file.</thinking>

# Orthomolecular Facial Analysis

## Beauty From Within!

Orthomolecular Facial Analysis identifies tissue salt deficiencies and toxicities by mapping the face, skin, and eyes. It aims to recommend cellular nutrient supplementation to tackle signs of aging (wrinkles, sagging), reduce acne, and improve skin quality by addressing the root cause of these issues.

## What is Orthomolecular Beauty Therapy?

It's based on the orthomolecular approach, which believes that health and appearance improve by optimizing the molecular environment for cells through natural substances, as the skin reflects internal health. Particularly recommended for those considering Botox or fillers to address underlying issues.

## What are the benefits of Orthomolecular Beauty Therapy?

- Diminished appearance of fine lines and wrinkles
- Improved circulation
- Improved elasticity
- Reduced sagging
- Firmer skin and eyelids
- Reduced jowls and neckline
- Skin pigment improvement
- Cleared up or reduced acne
- Lymphatic drainage
- Reduced inflammation
- Improved facial symmetry
- Reversal of hair thinning
- And many more!

## How many appointments are needed?

After the first appointment, clients receive a written evaluation and treatment recommendations, and can purchase recommended formulas. During the first year, a follow-up consultation every 3 months is advised for adjustments. The time to see noticeable improvement depends on the severity of underlying issues, as the service addresses root causes.
